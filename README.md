This repository contains data used in Twist et al. publication Kelp settlement and urchin larval metamorphosis on cryptic coralline algae with implications for kelp forest recovery.

Data are separated into four seperate data folders and one figure folder each with a corresponding R scripts and raw data, outlined below.

(1) coralline_relative-abund 

Contains data from Hind et al. 2019 - Trophic control of cryptic coralline algal diversity- Data on abundance of DNA identified coralline algae species from kelp forest and urchin barren sites- Re-analyzed to get a relative abundance of the coralline species in kelp forests compared to urchin barrens.

(2) Kelp

Contains data and code for the analysis the of density of juvenile sporophyte stages of three different kelp species (Costaria costata, Macrocystis pyrifera and Nereocystis luetkea) on DNA identified coralline algal species.

(3) Microbiome

Contains data and code for the analysis of the microbiome on the surface of a number of DNA identified crustose coralline algal species.

(4) Urchin

Contains data and code for the analysis of metamorphosis of the red sea urchin (Mesocentrotus franciscanus) on DNA identified coralline algal species.
